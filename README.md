# Jabber-Net20
Fork of [ForNeVer/Jabber-Net](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/Jabber-Net) compiled for .NET Framework 2.0

I just took needed parts of the repository to make the library work on top of .NET Framework 2.0.
It has not been thoroughly tested, but most basic features seem to work just fine. It should be considered to be work-in-progress.

This is just a re-package of the repository mentioned above, so same licenses apply. I take no ownership over this code.
